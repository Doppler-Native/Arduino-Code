# Arduino Server Code for connecting with Doppler


## What is Doppler?

Doppler’s main goal is to give makers a native Android application that communicates with Arduino. The main target platform is the ever popular esp8266. 

By using Doppler, hardware that provides human interaction such as switches and variable resistors can be done away with. Doppler’s functionality provide on screen controls that mimic toggle switches, momentary switches and variable inputs.

Unlike other solutions and tutorials which have a specific end use, Doppler is customisable. There are literally endless possibilities provided by this functionality; a remote camera shutter controller, remote light control switch and dimmer or motor intensity control just to name a few.

## How can it help you?

Want to build or prototype a project that needs human interaction via a mobile application? Doppler  has got you covered.

It allows you to develop hardware code almost freely, without worrying how to implement remote controls. You are only limited by the format which the mobile device will pass data.

## The future for Doppler?

- iOS release
- Improved UI
- More control types
- Server template for interacting with micropython
- Server template for interacting with python for Raspberry Pi's and PC/macOS/Linux
- More tutorials
